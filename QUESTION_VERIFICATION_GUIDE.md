  - Problem: Play-by-play details require deep navigation

### Obvious/Guaranteed Answers (Avoid These)
- **❌ "Will Bitcoin's last digit be odd in the next 15 minutes?"**
  - Problem: OBVIOUS YES - crypto prices change constantly, guaranteed to be odd at some point
- **❌ "Will any cryptocurrency change price in the next 15 minutes?"**
  - Problem: OBVIOUS YES - crypto markets are active 24/7, prices always fluctuate
- **❌ "Will Bitcoin remain #1 by market cap in the next 15 minutes?"**

- **❌ "Will Bitcoin be between $48,000-$52,000 in the next 15 minutes?"**
  - Problem: COMPLEX VERIFICATION - ranges are harder to check than simple current price comparison

### Weather Changes (Avoid These)

## Key Principles

2. **No Deep Navigation**: Answer should be visible on main pages/homepages
3. **Objective Facts**: No subjective interpretations required
4. **Real-Time Data**: Information updates frequently and is current
5. **Popular Sources**: Verification sites are well-known and trusted
6. **BALANCED OUTCOMES**: Questions should have roughly 50/50 chance for YES/NO answers

## Balanced vs. Obvious Examples

### ✅ BALANCED (Good)
- "Will Elon Musk post in the next 15 minutes?" (~30-50% chance)
- "Will Bitcoin be above its current price?" (perfect 50/50 chance)
- "Will CNN publish an article?" (~40-60% chance)  
- "Will Apple stock be above its current price?" (perfect 50/50 chance)

### ❌ OBVIOUS (Avoid)
- "Will Bitcoin's price change?" (99.9% YES - prices always fluctuate)
- "Will any digit appear in the price?" (100% YES - all prices have digits)
- "Will time pass?" (100% YES - time always moves forward)
- "Will it be daytime somewhere?" (100% YES - Earth rotation ensures this)

This approach ensures users face genuinely uncertain outcomes that create engaging prediction experiences.
